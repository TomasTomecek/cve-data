# CVE Research

This is a research project of CVE fixes.

## Files in this repo

* `script-upstream.py` - process CVE in a given upstream python project
* `cve.json` - analysis for respective python projects

In the current state we are only interested in Python projects and CVE fixes
that take place in a single code file. More complex fixes are skipped for now.


## JSON structure

* `cve_id`: CVE ID, in the form of `CVE-{number}-{number}`, empty if not detected

### Upstream project metadata

* `upstream_patch`: diff of the upstream code fix (fixes composed of multiple commits are not detected right now)
* `upstream_commit_hash`: upstream commit hash that fixes the CVE (can be used in the upstream git repo)
* `upstream_commit_message`: commit message of the single commit that fixed the CVE
* `upstream_code_before`: source file *before* applying the patch
* `upstream_code_after`: source file *after* applying the patch
* `upstream_project`: name of the open-source project where the CVE occurred

### Downstream project metadata

Not available yet.

* `downstream_patch`: TBD


## Example run

You need to have python3 and git available on your system to run it.

```
$ ./script-upstream.py
[
  {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2023-...
```

This will print a json-formatted metadata described above. The script will
clone selected high-profile python projects and analyze them. It creates a
directory called "workspace" where the analysis will happen. Please be aware
the git repos take several gigabytes on a disk.
