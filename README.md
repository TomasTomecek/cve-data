# CVE Research

This is a research project of CVE fixes.

## Files in this repo

* `script-upstream.py` - process CVE in a given upstream python project
* `*.json` - analysis for respective python projects

In the current state we are only interested in Python projects and CVE fixes
that take place in a single code file. More complex fixes are skipped.


## JSON structure

* `patch`: diff of the code fix
* `commit_message`: commit message of the single commit that fixed the CVE
* `code_before`: source file *before* applying the patch
* `code_after`": source file *after* applying the patch


## Example run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/django/django /tmp/django

$ ./script-upstream.py /tmp/django django/
```

This will print a json-formatted metadata for CVE fixes that happened in a
single source file.
