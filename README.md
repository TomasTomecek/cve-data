# CVE Research

This is a research project of CVE fixes.

## Files in this repo

* `script-upstream.py` - process CVE in a given upstream python project
* `cve.json` - analysis for respective python projects

In the current state we are only interested in Python projects and CVE fixes
that take place in a single code file. More complex fixes are skipped for now.


## JSON structure

* `patch`: diff of the code fix
* `commit_message`: commit message of the single commit that fixed the CVE
* `code_before`: source file *before* applying the patch
* `code_after`: source file *after* applying the patch
* `project`: name of the project where the CVE occured


## Example run

```
$ ./script-upstream.py
```

This will print a json-formatted metadata described above. The script will
clone selected high-profile python projects and analyze them. It creates a
directory called "workspace" where the analysis will happen. Please be aware
the git repos take several gigabytes on a disk.
